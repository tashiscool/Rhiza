# Nested Communication Channels - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Concept Implemented

**You asked for**: The ability for the mesh to communicate in various ways - "from the intimacy of family, to the voice of the village, to the chorus of regions, to the global tide, to the smaller circles of shared passions."

**What we built**: A complete hierarchical communication system with 5 nested scopes and intelligent message routing.

## 🌐 Communication Hierarchy

### The Five Scopes (Ultra-compressed: family → village → region → world → chosen circles)

| Scope | Poetic Description | Size Limit | Trust Required | Privacy Level |
|-------|-------------------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| **FAMILY** | "whispers at the hearth" | 1-8 nodes | 90% | Private |
| **VILLAGE** | "songs of the village" | 20-150 nodes | 80% | Selective |
| **REGION** | "councils of regions" | 500-5000 nodes | 70% | Selective |
| **WORLD** | "the great chorus of the world" | Unlimited | 60% | Open |
| **CHOSEN** | "secret circles of shared obsession" | Up to 500 | 70% | Selective |

## 🔄 Message Flow Patterns

### 1. **ESCALATION** - "family → village → region → world"
- **Use Case**: Local issues that need broader help
- **Example**: Medical emergency starts in family, escalates to village doctor, then regional emergency services
- **Trust Override**: Lower barriers for emergencies (0.5 instead of normal thresholds)

### 2. **BROADCAST** - "all scopes simultaneously"  
- **Use Case**: Emergency announcements or celebrations
- **Example**: "Global climate action coordination needed" → reaches all levels at once
- **Priority**: CHORUS level messages get maximum visibility

### 3. **PERCOLATION** - "ideas bubble up through levels"
- **Use Case**: Innovation spreading organically
- **Example**: Quantum computing breakthrough starts in chosen circle, bubbles up to academic networks

### 4. **AFFINITY** - "chosen circles only"
- **Use Case**: Specialized knowledge sharing
- **Example**: Technical discussions stay within expertise communities
- **Trust**: Specialized trust + expertise verification

### 5. **INTIMATE** - "family scope only"
- **Use Case**: Personal matters stay private
- **Example**: "Family dinner plans" never leaves family circle
- **Privacy**: Forced private mode + end-to-end encryption

## 🧠 Intelligent Routing Rules

The system automatically routes messages based on content analysis:

### Emergency Escalation Rule
- **Triggers**: Keywords like "help", "emergency", "urgent" + high priority
- **Action**: Immediate escalation through hierarchy
- **Trust Override**: Lowers trust barriers to 0.5 for emergency access

### Local Community Rule  
- **Triggers**: Keywords like "local", "neighborhood", "community"
- **Action**: Routes to village scope only
- **Trust**: Requires high trust (0.8) for local credibility

### Specialized Knowledge Rule
- **Triggers**: Technical terms, expertise keywords
- **Action**: Routes to relevant chosen circles
- **Trust**: Requires specialized trust (0.7) + expertise verification

### Global Discussion Rule
- **Triggers**: Keywords like "global", "world", "humanity"  
- **Action**: Direct to world scope
- **Consensus**: High threshold (0.6) for global visibility

### Family Privacy Rule
- **Triggers**: Keywords like "family", "personal", "private"
- **Action**: Locks to family scope only
- **Privacy**: Forces private mode + encryption

- **Privacy**: Private with end-to-end encryption
- **Members**: Maximum 8 nodes
- **Consensus**: Not required (family decisions)

### Village Level (Community Trust)
- **Trust Threshold**: 80% - high community standing
- **Privacy**: Selective sharing within community
- **Members**: Up to 150 nodes (Dunbar's number)
- **Consensus**: Required with 70% threshold

### Region Level (Civic Trust)
- **Trust Threshold**: 70% - broader civic participation
- **Privacy**: Selective with optional encryption
- **Members**: Up to 5,000 nodes
- **Consensus**: Required with 60% threshold

### World Level (Basic Trust)
- **Trust Threshold**: 60% - minimum for global participation
- **Privacy**: Open communication
- **Members**: Unlimited
- **Consensus**: Required with 50% threshold

### Chosen Circles (Specialized Trust)
- **Trust Threshold**: 70% - expertise-based trust
- **Privacy**: Group encryption for specialized discussions
- **Members**: Up to 500 nodes per circle
- **Consensus**: Required with 70% threshold for quality

## 🔄 Real-World Escalation Example

**Scenario**: "Car broke down on rural road, need help"

1. **0 min - FAMILY**: "Send to family circle"
   - Result: No response (family busy)

2. **15 min - VILLAGE**: "Escalate to village"  
   - Result: Local mechanic responds

3. **30 min - REGION**: "Alert regional network"
   - Result: Backup help dispatched

4. **RESOLVED**: "Help arrives"
   - Outcome: Multi-layer response successful
