## 🔄 Integration Flow

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **User Input** → Palm Slab receives query
2. **Authentication** → Biometric verification (palm print)
3. **Intent Analysis** → Verify user's true intention
4. **Coercion Check** → Detect if user is being pressured
5. **Model Selection** → Choose appropriate GGUF model for task
6. **Local Inference** → Generate response via KoboldCpp
7. **Trust Validation** → Comprehensive validation pipeline:
   - Bias/manipulation detection
   - Factual claim verification
   - Peer consensus gathering
   - Historical accuracy assessment
8. **Mesh Confidence** → Calculate final trust score
9. **Response Delivery** → Return validated response to user

## 📊 Trust Metrics System

### Validation Dimensions:
- **Social Consensus** (0-1): Peer agreement score
- **Factual Alignment** (0-1): Truth verification score
- **Bias Detection** (0-1): Lower is better - manipulation detection
- **Source Credibility** (0-1): Model reputation and track record
- **Historical Accuracy** (0-1): Past performance in the mesh
- **Context Relevance** (0-1): Response relevance to original query
- **Mesh Confidence** (0-1): Overall trust score (weighted combination)

### Decision Thresholds:
- **> 0.8**: Response approved with high confidence
- **0.6-0.8**: Response conditionally approved with monitoring
- **< 0.6**: Response rejected or flagged for additional validation

## 🍎 Apple M4 Pro Optimizations

### Hardware Utilization:
- **48GB Unified Memory**: Shared between CPU/GPU for optimal model loading
- **18-core Neural Engine**: Accelerated inference for compatible models
- **20-core GPU + Metal**: GPU acceleration via Metal Performance Shaders
